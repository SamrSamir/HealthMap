# About the project
“HealthMap” is a multi platform mobile application that crowd-sources information to compare environmental factors and occurrence of 
symptoms of allergies and respiratory diseases. Reporting of this data is simple, efficient, and intuitive. First off, users can learn 
about the names and the exact description of their allergy or respiratory disease symptoms through the media library in “HealthMap”. 
Next, our interactive wizard walks the user through various inquisitions to collect data such as type, frequency and intensity of the 
cough, personal stats, colour of the phlegm, symptoms experienced such as shortness of breath, wheezing, sneezing, nasal obstruction, or 
itchy eyes, diagnosis of the doctor, if available, and graphical selection of the latest locations that the user has been in. Automatic 
detection of the user’s current location, and collection of the corresponding environmental factors are also performed.

Our database is updated with user-filled data in realtime for a seamless system user interaction experience. The user can visualise all of
the crowd-sourced data collected throughout the globe using either our mobile application, or our dedicated web portal. Each marker on our
world map interface, a symptom map with NASA provided data, represents a report instance. Upon a simple click of such a marker, the user is
shown a comprehensive and visually rich report of the health and environmental factors information to better conceptualise the relationship
between them.

# About the web portal

The HealthMap web portal is a dedicated symptom visualization map, allowing the users to interact with the worldwide crowd-sourced data of health symptoms and related environmental factors. 

![Web Portal 1](/../master/readmeScreenshots/websiteMainPageScreenshot.png?raw=true "Main page")

A simple map interface represents all report instances provided by users on a global scale with localized markers. Interactive aspects of the map permit users to easily zoom in and view all of reports from a certain region or city. The user can view each report separately by simply clicking on the dedicated marker, which directs him/her to a visually rich report representing all collected data and statistics.

Each report depicts comprehensive information related to health and environmental factors to better conceptualise the relationship between them. Each report focuses on respiratory diseases, as environmental factors and air quality information largely influence the development of such diseases. As such, each report serves as a promising tool to analyze and study the connections between health and environmental factors on a global scale. This has a direct impact on the study of how the global climate change influences the global health status.
